Hi, we are @plantmicrobeecology, the Plant Microbe Ecology group at the Radboud Instute for Biological and Environmental Sciences of the Radboud University in Nijmegen (the Netherlands).
Our lab currently consists of Dr Bjorn Robroek (PI), Dr Janna Barel (postdoc), Yvet Telgenkamp (PhD candidate) and Rosa Boone (PhD Candidate). 
We aim to make cutting-edge advances in understanding the underlying principles of plant and soil community assembly and how this plays out on ecosystem functioning in the context of enviro-climatic change. 
Our work encompasses understanding the functional attributes of above- and belowground communities, and how these contribute to the resistance and resilience of ecosystems in a changing world. 
The knowledge we develop is key for developing management tools to improve ecosystem sustainability facing climate change. 
To answer our ecological questions, which are overall of fundamental nature, we draw on a combination of fieldwork across spatial scales, lab-studies and mesocosms experiments.
